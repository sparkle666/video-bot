00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
One of the myths bordering One Punch Man has been whether or

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,800
not our beloved sassy lost child wears undies or not.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,400
For years, there have been rumors that she doesn't wear panties.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,560
And this has been a topic of fierce discussion for

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,080
the One Punch Man fandom on whether Tatsumaki wear one or not.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,480
Well, this is because there are several shorts like this one, this one, this one,

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,780
and this one where it is actually visible that Tatsumaki don't wear any.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,000
But then on the chapter 181 of One Punch Man,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,400
where Tatsumaki squares off with Saitama, it has been shown right here in a chibi

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,520
version that Tatsumaki actually wears panties.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,320
Wait, are those panties or diapers?

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,960
And of course, the only man who can see her at such an awkward situation without

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,600
getting twisted to death has to be the strongest man alive in the name of King,

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:56,600
as expected of King whose power knows no bounds.
