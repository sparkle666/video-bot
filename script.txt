Script:	One of the myths bordering OPM has been whether or not our beloved sassy lost child wears undies or no.
For years, there have been rumours that she doesn't wear panties.

And this has been a topic of fierce discussion for the
One Punch Man fandom on whether TATSUMAKI wear one or no.

Well this is because there are several shorts like this
one, this one, this one and this one where it is actually
visible that Tatsumaki don't wear any.

But then on the Chapter 181 of One punch Man where tatsumaki squares off with saitama, It has been shown right here in a chibi version that Tatsumaki actually wears panties.

Wait, are those panties or daipers?

And of course, the only man who can see her at such an awkward situation without getting twisted to death has to be the strongest Man alive in the name of King.

As expected of King whose power knows no bounds.
